# SimplPass

SimplPass is an extremely basic and lightweight CLI password manager designed to be fast, usable and secure.

## Why SimplPass?

SimplPass was designed so your passwords are owned by you and stored on your own machine, instead of servers like what most modern day password managers do. In this day and age where digital monitoring has gotten extremely advanced, you can never actually be
sure whether or not a company is storing your data securely or not. With SimplPass, your data will **never** leave your own machine unless you want to move it somewhere else. SimplPass is fully and forever open source, meaning you can check the source code
for yourself, and if you want to, make your own modifications so it can best suit you and your workflow.

Remember - SimplPass can protect your passwords to an **extent**. Due to how SimplPass uses encryption, it is difficult for an attacker to steal your passwords from the file where your passwords are stored. However, this does not make it immune to attackers watching your screen when opening your password vault. Be careful with what you run online, and never share your passwords.

## To do

## Note

SimplPass is extremely buggy in it's current state and alot of stuff just doesnt work. If you genuinely intend on using it then be prepared to mess with some of the code to egt it working. Not much work is needed it's basically just the encryption that doesnt work.
